Obesity Level Estimation
Introduction
This report explores an obesity dataset, encompassing variables like food consumption, physical activity, and demographics. The goal is to predict obesity levels using machine learning models. The dataset includes attributes such as calorie intake, physical activity, gender, age, height, and weight.

Dataset Analysis
Initial data wrangling involved handling missing values and outliers. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) provided insights into variable distributions and relationships.

Distribution

Feature Observation and Hypothesis
Feature selection strategies, including correlation-based and variance threshold, were applied. Models were built using selected features.

Model Implementation
Various machine learning models were employed:

Logistic Regression
Gradient Boosting Classifier
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Naive Bayes
Random Forest
Confusion Matrix

Results Interpretation and Implications
Models were evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Random Forest outperformed others with 91.81% accuracy, demonstrating reliability in predicting diverse weight categories.

Out-of-Sample Predictions
Simulated real-world predictions indicated the model's practical applicability, showcasing potential in production environments.

Concluding Remarks
This project contributes valuable insights into obesity-related factors, offering predictive models for weight category estimation. Further refinement and exploration may optimize models for specific healthcare applications.
